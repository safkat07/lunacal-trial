# Lunacal Frontend Developer Intern Task

## Overview

This project is a frontend task built as part of the recruitment process for a Frontend Developer Intern position at Lunacal. The task includes two main sections: an **About** widget and a **Gallery** widget, each designed to demonstrate interactive UI components with smooth animations.

## Features

### 1. About Widget
The **About** widget consists of three tabs:
- **About**
- **Experience**
- **Recommended**

Each tab displays specific content fetched from a JSON file located in the `public` directory. When switching between tabs, a custom animation enhances the user experience, making the transitions smooth and visually appealing.

- **Custom Hook**: A custom hook is used to fetch and manage the data for the tabs.
- **Tab Switching Animation**: Includes a left-to-right or right-to-left sliding animation to highlight the transition between tabs.
- **Dynamic Content**: Each tab displays relevant data based on the selected option, allowing for easy customization.

### 2. Gallery Widget
The **Gallery** widget is a custom image slider that supports adding new images dynamically. Each slide is displayed with a beautiful transition animation.



- **Custom Image Slider**: Built from scratch, the slider supports smooth sliding transitions.
- **Dynamic Image Handling**: New images can be added easily, and the slider updates to accommodate them.
- **Responsive Design**: The slider adapts to different screen sizes for an optimal viewing experience.
